# Harmonic Engine

## Concept Overview
The **Harmonic Engine** is a specialized simulation engine within Atheria that combines **Sparse Matter** with a **Harmonic Vacuum**. Unlike traditional cellular automata where empty space is truly empty (zero), the Harmonic Engine simulates a dynamic vacuum field generated by wave interferences.

## Core Principles
1.  **Harmonic Vacuum**: A background field generated by the superposition of multiple standing waves (sine/cosine functions) with random but fixed phases and frequencies. This creates a "terrain" of potential energy even in the absence of matter.
2.  **Sparse Matter**: Matter particles are stored in a sparse dictionary structure `{(x,y,z): state_tensor}`, allowing for infinite or very large universes where only active regions are computed.
3.  **Matter-Vacuum Interaction**: Matter particles interact with the local vacuum field. The vacuum can influence particle stability, movement, or generation, depending on the specific model rules (Ley M).

## Architecture
The engine is implemented in `src/engines/harmonic_engine.py` and consists of two main classes:
-   `HarmonicVacuum`: Handles the procedural generation of the vacuum field using wave equations.
-   `SparseHarmonicEngine`: Manages the sparse matter dictionary, computes interactions, and handles the simulation loop.

## Key Features
-   **Infinite Canvas**: Because the vacuum is procedural (calculated on the fly based on coordinates) and matter is sparse, the simulation can conceptually extend infinitely.
-   **Procedural Complexity**: The vacuum adds a layer of complexity and "texture" to the simulation without requiring memory storage for empty space.
-   **Deterministic Chaos**: The vacuum is deterministic (based on fixed random seeds for wave parameters), ensuring reproducibility.

## Usage
The Harmonic Engine is selected by setting `ENGINE_TYPE = 'HARMONIC'` in the experiment configuration or by forcing the engine type during load.
